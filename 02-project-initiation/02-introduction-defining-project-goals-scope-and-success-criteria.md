# Determining project goals and deliverables
- Goals and deliverables must be exactly defined before a project is started

## Project Goals
- A project goal is the desired outcome of the project
  - Increasing revenue by 5% by the end of the year through a new service offering
  - Improve response time by 20% via email
- Well defined goals are specific and tells what to achieve and how to achieve them
- Goals must be measurable
- To define goals, talk to the stakeholders

## Project deliverables
- The products or services that are created for the customer, client or the sponsor
- What gets produced or presented at the end of the task, event or process
  - Launching a new website can be a deliverable
  - A new template or a questionarre in an email can be an example
- A report is also a deliverable
  - When a goal is reached, a report shows what has been achieved
- Deliverables must be well-defined similar to goals
- Must be decided upfront with stakeholders and clients
- A big part of achieving the goal

# How to set SMART goals
- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Just improving customer success is not very specific

## Specific
- Specific goals must at least answer:
  - What do I want to accomplish?
  - Why is this a goal?
  - Who is involved?
  - Where should the goal be delivered?
  - To what degree?

## Measurable
- How much? 
- How many? 
- How will I know when it is accomplished?
- Metrics, such as figures or numbers make goal measurable
- Benchmarks can be used to help create measurable goals

## Attainable
- Can the goal be reasonably achieveble? 
- You do not want the goal to be too extreme - you failed even before you started

## Relevant
- Does your goal align with other goals, organizations needs and priorities?
- Is the goal worth supporting?

## Time-bound
- Goes hand in hand with metrics
- A goal must be time-bound otherwise you will never reach it

# Introduction to OKRs
- Objectives and Key Results
- OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome
- They provide specific details to allow you to measure success of a goal

## Objective
- Defines what needs to be achieved
- Desribes a desired outcome

## Key Results
- Measurable outcomes that defined an objective is met
- Define how you will know whether or not you met your objective

## OKR Levels
- Company level 
- Project level

# Determining a project's scope
- Boundries of a project
- Agreed upon understanding to what is included and what is excluded
- Who will be using the project
- Includes:
  - Timeline
  - Budget
  - Resources
- Poorly defined scope can change budget, timeline or the outcome of the project
- How to scope of project?
  - Talk to your stakeholders and sponsors
  - Figure out what is and what is not inclued in the project
- Where did the project come from?
- Why is it needed?
- What is the project expected to achieve?
- What does the project sponsor have in mind?
- Who approves the final results?

## Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope
- Tasks included in project plan: in-scope
- Tasks excluded in project plan: out-of-scope
## Scope Creep
- Changes, growth and uncontrolled factors that affect a projet's scope at any point after the project begins
  - i.e. when a projectâ€™s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase
- Scope creep can be internal or external
  - Customer requests
  - Environment shifts
- Solutions
  - Make project plans visible
  - Get clarity on project requirements
  - Set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement
  - Create a plan for dealing out-of-scope change requests
  - Put your agreements in writing
- Internal Scope Creep
  - Comes from members of the team
  - Suggestions on product or process improvements
- Any time a member takes an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on the task

## Managing changes to a project's scope
- Goes in hand in hand with goal setting
- Changing the goal can change the scope
- Responsibility of a Project Manager is to deliver the project within the agreed scope
- Triple Constrains Modal
  - Scope
  - Time
  - Cost
- Time refers to the project schedule and deadlines
- Cost covers budget and resources
- Both time and cost must be managed carefully alongside scope

# Measuring a project's success
## Launching and landing a project
- Delivering the project to the client is called the project launch
- Landing is when you actually measure the success of your project
  - This is often overlooked in the initiation phase
## Defining success criteria
- Tells you whether or not the project was successful
- Specific details of project goals, deliverables, requirements and expectations
- The standards by which the project will be judged once it's been delivered to stakeholders
- There is no standards
  - Ask: How will I know when the project is a success? 
  - Use your goals and metrics
  - Get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations
  - Document all clarity so you can refer to it later

# Working effectively with stakeholders
- Stakeholders: People who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success

## Choosing a project team
- Choosing the right team is a very big task
  - These are the people who will be doing the tasks
- Consider:
  - Required roles
  - Team size
  - Necessary skills
  - Availability
  - Motivation (Key ingredient to success)

## Defining project roles
- Project Sponsor: The person who's accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon business benefits
- Team Members: People doing the day to day work
- Customer: People who will get value from the project
- Users: People who will use the product produced
- Stakeholders: Anyone involved in the project who has a vested interest in the project's success
- Project Manager: Person who plans, organizes and oversees the project

# Evaluating Stakeholders
- Primary stakeholders are people who will benefit directly from the project's success, while secondary stakeholders are indirectly impacted by the project's success

## Completing a stakeholder analysis
- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
  - Influence: How much power a stakeholder has
  - Interest: How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcumes
- Assess stakeholders' ability to participate and then find ways to involve them

## Assigning project team roles and responsibilities
- RACI Chart
  - Responsible: Those doing the work to complete task
  - Accountable: Those making sure the work is done
  - Consulted: Giving feedback, subject matter experts
  - Informed: Those who just need to be informed/know a task is complete
