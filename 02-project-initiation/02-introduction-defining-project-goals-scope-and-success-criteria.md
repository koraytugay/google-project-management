# Determining project goals and deliverables
- Goals and deliverables must be exactly defined before a project is started

## Project Goals
- A project goal is the desired outcome of the project
  - Increasing revenue by 5% by the end of the year through a new service offering
  - Improve response time by 20% via email
- Well defined goals are specific and tells what to achieve and how to achieve them
- Goals must be measurable
- To define goals, talk to the stakeholders

## Project deliverables
- The products or services that are created for the customer, client or the sponsor
- What gets produced or presented at the end of the task, event or process
  - Launching a new website can be a deliverable
  - A new template or a questionarre in an email can be an example
- A report is also a deliverable
  - When a goal is reached, a report shows what has been achieved
- Deliverables must be well-defined similar to goals
- Must be decided upfront with stakeholders and clients
- A big part of achieving the goal

# How to set SMART goals
- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
- Just improving customer success is not very specific

## Specific
- Specific goals must at least answer:
  - What do I want to accomplish?
  - Why is this a goal?
  - Who is involved?
  - Where should the goal be delivered?
  - To what degree?

## Measurable
- How much? 
- How many? 
- How will I know when it is accomplished?
- Metrics, such as figures or numbers make goal measurable
- Benchmarks can be used to help create measurable goals

## Attainable
- Can the goal be reasonably achieveble? 
- You do not want the goal to be too extreme - you failed even before you started

## Relevant
- Does your goal align with other goals, organizations needs and priorities?
- Is the goal worth supporting?

## Time-bound
- Goes hand in hand with metrics
- A goal must be time-bound otherwise you will never reach it

# Introduction to OKRs
- Objectives and Key Results
- OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome
- They provide specific details to allow you to measure success of a goal

## Objective
- Defines what needs to be achieved
- Desribes a desired outcome

## Key Results
- Measurable outcomes that defined an objective is met
- Define how you will know whether or not you met your objective

## OKR Levels
- Company level 
- Project level
