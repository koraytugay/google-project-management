# Understanding Project Resource Needs
- It is important to figuring out resources before the project starts
  - Budget: Estimate amount of money needed to complete a project
  - People: Team of people who will be working on the project is also resources
  - Project materials
- Tools help
  - Track tasks
  - Manage budget
  - Collaborate with team mates

# Developing documentation for project kick-off
- Project Proposal: A form of document persuades stakeholders to begin a project
  - Great starting point
  - A presentation, an email
- Project Charter: A formal document that clearly defines the goals of the project, and outlines the necessary details needed to reach its goals
  - Comes at the end of the initiation phase
  - Defines key details of the project
  - Serves as a point of reference throughout the project
- Project proposal is created earlier in the project lifecycle compared to the project charter

## Project Charter
- Makes clear the benefits of the project outweighs the costs
  - This is a question you ask when you do cost-benefit analysis
  - What value will the project create?
  - How much money can this project save my organization?
  - How much time will people spend on this project?
  - Answers to these questions are included in the Project Charter
- Project Charter ensures you and the stakeholders agree on the details of the project
- Project Charter approval means management is supportive
- After the sponsor and stakeholders approve the charter, project manager has the authority to move forward with the project
- Project Charter format can be different based on the audience or other needs
- Project Charter is a living document, it evolves throughout the project process
