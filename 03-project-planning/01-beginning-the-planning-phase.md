# Understanding the planning phase components

## Benefits of Project Planning
- Project manager and team determines the workflows and processes to achieve the goals
- Draw from previous projects and do not be afraid of new ideas
- Helps understand the work needed to achieve the goals
- Coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams
- Identify and prepare for risks
- Get "buy-in" from key members of the project team
  - buy-in: Gain support for your plans
- Shows the stakeholders team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan

## Launching the planning phase
- Planning phase is the second phase of the project life-cycle
  - Plans do not need to be perfect the first time
  - Plans will change as the project evolves anyway
- Schedule
- Budget
- Risk Management

### Schedule
- A timeline of the project
  - Start date - end date - dates for things in between
  - We will use date planning methodologies

### Budget
- Total cost of the project
  - Needs to be broken down on how much to spend on project element

### Risk Management
- Searching for problems and planning ahead to mitigate them
  - Risk is inevitable, how the risk impacts the project is not inevitable

## Facilitating a project kick-off meeting
- A formal start to project planning
- The first meeting in which a project team comes together to 
  - Ground everyone in a shared vision
  - Gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope
  - Understand each individuals roles
- Who is invited?
  - Project Team members identified in the RACI chart
  - Stakeholders
  - Sponsor
- Team members can ask their questions in this meeting
- Kick-off meeting covers:
  - Introductions
  - Project Background
  - Goals and Scope
  - Roles
  - Collaboration
  - What Comes Next

# Defining tasks and milestones
## Understanding tasks and milestones
- Project milestones 
  - An important point within the schedule that indicates progress
  - Signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project
- Project Task
  - An activity that needs to be completed in a certain time
- A milestone is reached by completing multiple tasks

## The importance of setting milestones
- Setting milestones gives you understanding for amount of work needed
- Forces you to have managable chunks of work
- Milestones help you keep your project on track
- Milestones help uncover areas where you need to adjust scope, timelines or resources
- Reaching milestones motivate the team and illustrate progress to stakeholders
- Milestones serve as a check-in point for the stakeholders
- Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order

## How to set milestones
- Evaluate your project as a whole
- Make a list of what is needed to complete your project - these are your milestones
- Smaller items will be tasks
- Once you determine your milestones - assign them deadlines 
- Consider the needs of the stakeholders
  - Stakeholders want to see progress and milestones are good way to show progress

## Creating a work breakdown structure
- WBS: A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy in the order they need to be completed
- WBS is not included in the project plan - instead the tasks identified and milestones are moved into a spreadsheet
- After completing the Work Breakdown Structure, you should have
  - A set of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones
  - Team members assigned to each task
- Tasks are assigned according to the persons role in the project
