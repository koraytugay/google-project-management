  - Too much optimism may lead to risks
- Teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the estimates
- Sub-tasks help with realistic time estimates
- Asking a teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation
- Buffer: Extra time added to the end of a task or a project to account for unexpected slowdowns or delays in work progress
