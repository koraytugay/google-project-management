# Understanding risk management
## The importance of risk management
- A potential event which can occur and can impact your project
  - Not events that will definetly happen but might happen
- An issue is a known or a real problem that can affect the ability to complete a task
- A risk an event that could potentially happen, if the event happens the risk becomes issue
- Risks compose threat to your projects
- Risk Management: The process of identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact a project
- If you do not plan ahead - project may not meet project goals

## Phases of risk management
- Identify the risk
- Analyze the risk
  - Determine the likelihood and potential impact to your project
- Evaluate the risk
  - Determine which risks to priotirize
- Treat the risk
  - Make a plan to how to treat and manage the risk
  - Create mitigation plans
- Monitor and control the risk
  - Assign team members to monitor, track and mitigate risks

# Identifying and assessing risks
## Tools to help identify risks
- Brainstorming
- Cause and effect diagram
- Risk Register
  - A table of risks
- Risk Assessment
  - Qualities of risk are estimated: how likely it is to occur and potential impact
- Probability and impact matrix
- Probability: The likelihood that a risk will occur
- Impact: Damage a risk could couse: Low, Medium, High

## Types of risk
- Time risks: Possibility a project task will take longer than anticipated
- Budget risks: Possibility cost of the project will increase
- Scope risks: Possibility that a project won't produce the expected results
- External risks: Little to no control over, like a major storm or change in regulatory requirements
- Dependency: A start of a project depending on another project completing
  - Often a big source of risk for a project
  - Internal dependencies: Dependencies we have control over
  - External dependencies: Dependencies we have no control over

## Dependency relationships
- Four types of task dependencies
  - Finish to start
  - Finish to finish
  - Start to start
  - Start to finish

# Mitigating and communicating risks
## Risk mitigation strategies
- Common ways to deal with risk
  - Avoid
  - Acept
  - Reduce or control
  - Transfer

## Building a risk management plan
- Risk Management Plan: Living document that contains information regarding high level risks and the mitigation plans for those risks
- Risk Management is an ongoing practice
  - Should be updated regularly
  - Risks and mitigation plans
  - Also includes risk register
    - Table or a chart of possible risks
